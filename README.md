# Hi, I'm Anna! 👋🏻 👩🏽‍💻

📚 I'm a NYC teacher turned software enginner 💻 who is passionate about building tech that brings communities and generations together while elevating the quality of life. I enjoy working with JavaScript, ReactJs, Ruby and Ruby on Rails but am always eager to learn something new. Education is in my DNA and during my spare time, I like to read and contribute articles on Medium to learn and share with other devs. When I am not working on some side project, you'll find me cooking and feeding friends at home or snuggling with my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/coopersadventuresnyc/">rescue pup</a>. 🐶 🌵

## Currently I am... 💡
* Studying algorithms and data structures
* Working on side projects
* Open for new dev opportunities
