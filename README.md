# 👋🏻 Hello

I'm a people-first tech leader and former teacher with 7+ years of experience managing projects, building web applications, and empowering teams across a variety of B2C, B2B, Technology and Educational Services industry. Here’s a little TL;DR summary of my career:
- I have an extensive experience in **K-12 education creating and delivering highly effective lessons for ELLs** backed by best practice pedagogies
- I was a **Fullstack software engineer** at Newsela (SaaS Instructional Content Platform) where I developed a suite of web applications, internal tools, and technical solutions for the Customer Support, Sales, and the IT team. My work:
  -  optimized the customer onboarding and integration process,
  -  automated and oversaw rogue data clean up,
  -  secured customer and employee data while also protecting the Newsela application (was accountable for employee offboarding process as well),
  -  centralized complex layers of customer and product data into a dynamic dashboard, and
  -  improved the overall internal operations (Me and my team's work aided in $7.5MM in customer signings, 71% improvement in customer escalation handling time and over 70% reduction in temporary staffing hires during back-to-school surge).

I'm adept at project management, using agile and iterative approach. I'm especially good at breaking down complex technical concepts for my stakeholders (thank my classroom teaching experience!) and keeping everyone aligned on project (or strategic) goals throughout the development process. I believe in fostering cultures and software development processes that help teams do the best work of their lives in environments that are safe, healthy, and fulfilling. My goal is to always deliver high-end value to customers and bridge the gap between Customers Success, Product, and Engineering.

Outside of work you'll find me attempting a new recipe in the kitchen 👩🏻‍🍳, working on a home project  🏠🪚, or hiking with my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/coopersadventuresnyc/">rescue dog</a> 🦮.
