# Hi, I'm Anna! 👋🏻 👩🏽‍💻

📚 ->  💻  I'm a teacher turned software enginner who is passionate about building tech that will help bring communities together and serve a good purpose. I enjoy working with JavaScript, ReactJs, Ruby and Ruby on Rails but I'm always eager to learn something new every day. As an advocate for personal developnent and education, I like to spend my spare time reading and writing blogs to contribute back to the dev community. When I am not working on some side project, you'll find me cooking and feeding my friends while snuggling with my rescue puppy. 🐶 🌵
