# Hi, I'm Anna! 👋🏻 👩🏽‍💻

📚 ->  💻  I'm a teacher turned software enginner who is passionate about coding for a good cause and bringing communities together. Currently, I enjoy working with JavaScript, ReactJs, Ruby and Ruby on Rails but I am always curious to learn something new every day. On my spare time, I enjoy cooking and feeding crowds and snuggle with my rescue pup. 🐶 🌵
