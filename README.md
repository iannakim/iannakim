# Hello 👋🏻 👩🏻‍💻

I'm a people-first tech leader and a former teacher with 7+ years of experience managing projects and empowering teams across a variety of B2C, B2B, Technology and Educational Services industry. Here’s a TL;DR summary of my career:
- I have extensive experience in K-12 education creating and delivering highly effective lessons for ELLs backed by best practice pedagogies
- Fullstack engineer at Newsela (SaaS Instructional Content Platform) where my role was to develope a suite of internal web applications and & tools and technical solutions that support the customer support, sales, and the IT team. My work:
  -  optimized the customer onboarding** and integration process,
  -  automated and oversaw rogue data clean up,
  -  secured customer and employee data while also protecting the Newsela application (was accountable for employee offboarding for a while),
  -  centralized complex layers of customer and product data into a dynamic dashboard, and
  -  improved the overall internal operations (I aided in $7.5MM in customer signings, 71% improvement in customer escalation handling time and over 70% reduction in temporary staffing hires during back-to-school surge).

Adept at project management and excellent in communication, I am good at breaking down complex technical concepts for stakeholders (thank my classroom teaching experience!). Most importantly, I believe in fostering cultures and software development processes that help teams do the best work of their lives in environments that are safe, healthy, and fulfilling. I'm passionate about delivering high-end value to users and my goal is to bridge the gap between Customers Success, Product, and Engineering.

Outside of work you'll find me attempting a new recipe in the kitchen 👩🏻‍🍳, working on a home project  🏠🪚, or hiking with my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/coopersadventuresnyc/">rescue dog</a> 🦮.
