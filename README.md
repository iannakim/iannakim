# Hi, I'm Anna! 👋🏻 👩🏽‍💻

I'm a full stack developer with a strong background in teaching who is passionate about solving problems and creating intuitive user experiences. I'm experienced with JavaScript, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, React, Redux [still getting comfortable with it] and am always looking to learn new tech trends and improve my skills. Education is in my DNA and I love sharing what I know (as well as what I'm hoping to get better at) with other developers.  During my spare time I like to read, cook, hike, and snuggle with my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/coopersadventuresnyc/">rescue pup</a>. 🐶

## 🚧 Currently
* Studying algorithms and data structures to improve my problem solving skills
* Building a new project [Read.It] and refactoring/fixing bugs on previous projects
* Reading up on the latest tools and libraies to skill up on my frontend skills
