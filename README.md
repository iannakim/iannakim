# 👋🏻 Hello

I'm a people-first tech leader and former teacher with 7+ years of experience managing projects, building web applications, and empowering teams across a variety of B2C, B2B, Technology and Educational Services industry. Here’s a little TL;DR summary of my career:
- I have an extensive experience in **K-12 education creating and delivering highly effective lessons for ELLs** backed by best practice pedagogies
- I was a **Fullstack software engineer** at Newsela (SaaS Instructional Content Platform) where I developed a suite of web applications, internal tools, and technical solutions for the Customer Support, Sales, and the IT team. My work:
  -  optimized the customer onboarding and integration process,
  -  automated and oversaw rogue data clean up,
  -  secured customer and employee data while also protecting the Newsela application (was accountable for employee offboarding for a while),
  -  centralized complex layers of customer and product data into a dynamic dashboard, and
  -  improved the overall internal operations (I aided in $7.5MM in customer signings, 71% improvement in customer escalation handling time and over 70% reduction in temporary staffing hires during back-to-school surge).

Adept at project management and excellent in communication, I am good at breaking down complex technical concepts for stakeholders (thank my classroom teaching experience!). Most importantly, I believe in _fostering cultures and software development processes that help teams do the best work of their lives in environments that are safe, healthy, and fulfilling_. I'm passionate about delivering high-end value to users and my goal is to bridge the gap between Customers Success, Product, and Engineering.

Outside of work you'll find me attempting a new recipe in the kitchen 👩🏻‍🍳, working on a home project  🏠🪚, or hiking with my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/coopersadventuresnyc/">rescue dog</a> 🦮.
